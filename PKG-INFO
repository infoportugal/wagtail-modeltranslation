Description: The modeltranslation application can be used to translate dynamic
             content of existing Wagtail CMS models to an arbitrary number of
             languages without having to change the original model classes. It
             uses a registration approach (comparable to Django's admin app) to
             be able to add translations to existing or new projects and is
             fully integrated into the Django admin backend.

             The advantage of a registration approach is the ability to add
             translations to models on a per-project basis. You can use the
             same app in different projects, may they use translations or not,
             and you never have to touch the original model class.

========================
Wagtail Modeltranslation
========================

This app is based on django-modeltranslation: https://github.com/deschler/django-modeltranslation

It's an alternative approach for i18n support on Wagtail CMS websites.

The modeltranslation application is used to translate dynamic content of
existing Wagtail models to an arbitrary number of languages, without having to
change the original model classes. It uses a registration approach (comparable
to Django's admin app) to add translations to existing or new projects and is
fully integrated into the Wagtail admin UI.

The advantage of a registration approach is the ability to add translations to
models on a per-app basis. You can use the same app in different projects,
whether or not they use translations, and without touching the original
model class.
